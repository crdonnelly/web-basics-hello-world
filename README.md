# web-basics-hello-world
A super-basic (and ugly!) web page to show off the basics for SoT hackfest (html, css, js...).

Following this readme should help to prepare you for a weekend of API hacking by familiarising you with the basics of git, running a simple python server, and playing around with some web technologies to get a basic webpage to display some data from a simple API.

## Viewing the webpage in your browser
`python -m http.server 8000`

Once you've done all this you can carry on and play with things as much as you like. Add a paragraph to the page describing your idea for the ultimate burger, or add some stock images of scientists doing science things. Or maybe you can make the page less ugly with some css styling or do something fancy with javascript like displaying the current system time? You can also use javascript to explore some data from some other APIs that are out there.

## Completed example by SoT Team
If you want to you can checkout the branch called `example` to see what I did to finish the page. It might also help you if you get a bit stuck.
